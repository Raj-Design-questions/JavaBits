# Exercism Answers

_SPOILER ALERT_

The code here are my answers to a number of
[exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/java/about) exercises. If you are
actively working on any of these problems, these are valid solutions (at the
time of submission ... unit tests can change over time).

In general, I favored a Java 8 stream approach to solving these problems. This
doesn't mean the solutions are the most elegant or performant. I treated it as
an exercise in backporting my functional programming knowledge into Java to see
how it would turn out.
